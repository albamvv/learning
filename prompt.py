text = """The Second World War (also written World War II)1 was a global military \
conflict that took place between 1939 and 1945. It involved most of the world's \
nations - including all the major powers, as well as virtually all European nations \
- grouped into two opposing military alliances: the Allies on the one hand, and the \
Axis Powers on the other. It was the greatest war in history, with more than 100 \
million military personnel mobilized and a state of total war in which the major \
contenders devoted all their economic, military and scientific capabilities to the \
service of the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military \
resources."""

review1 = """Love these plugs, have a few now. We use them to plug in lights and \
set timers to turn them on and off via a phone app. Easy to use and linked to \
the internet and apps. Good value for money."""

review2 = """Tried and tried but could never get them to work right. Too bad \
I'm past my return date or they would have gone back."""

review3 = """A well-sized, reliable smart plug. The app is easy to use and set \
up, and works well. I used them to make several lamps. Everything works fine - \
no problems."""

review4 = """Great little product. Super easy to set up. Didn't even need to use \
the Alexa app to do so. Did it with my echo. Now I use it almost daily to turn on \
a light that was a pain to get to."""

review5 = """If I could give this zero stars I would. Plug wouldn’t connect. I \
had to keep connecting it and finally just gave up and returned it. Customer service \
was a complete waste of time."""
